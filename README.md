# Influence Texas

## An [ATX Hack for Change](http://atxhackforchange.org/) Project
This project was first worked on June 2-4 at St. Edward's campus for the 2017 ATX Hack for Change. In 2017 all ATX Hack for Change projects were aligned with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This project falls under [*Goal 16: Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies*](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/peace-justice/).

 _"The cornerstone of democracy rests on the foundation of an educated electorate."_ - Thomas Jefferson

<br />

## Purpose 
Informing the Texas electorate. 

## Reason
Voting drives are nice, but getting uninformed people to cast ballots is not helping anyone. Voters need a _quick_, _user-friendly_ way to tell who a politician really is.

Who has the time to search for hours and hours through newspapers and online articles in the (possibly vain) hope of finding unbiased information on each and every candidate?

Voters need to know:
1. whose money has the potential to influence a politician (campaign finance records).
1. how the politician voted (voting records).

By putting these two pieces of information together in a succinct mobile platform, we can turn uninformed voters into informed voters.
