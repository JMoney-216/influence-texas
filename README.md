# Influence Texas

## An [ATX Hack for Change](http://atxhackforchange.org/) Project
This project was first worked on June 2-4 at St. Edward's campus for the 2017 ATX Hack for Change. In 2017 all ATX Hack for Change projects were aligned with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This project falls under [*Goal 16: Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies*](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/peace-justice/).

 _"The cornerstone of democracy rests on the foundation of an educated electorate."_ - Thomas Jefferson

<br />

## Purpose 
Informing the Texas electorate. 

## Project Vision 
INFLUENCE TX puts campaign finance records next to voting records so taxpayers can track the influence of money in the Texas state political process. This is the only product people can use to find out who paid off their Texas state politicians and how they voted as a result.


For citizens interested in Texas state government who need an unbiased source they can use to determine what their politicians are really doing.


This product is a mobile-first responsive web app (with an advanced-user desktop version planned for future releases) that puts campaign finance and voting records in a usable format so citizens can see how money is influencing the political process

Unlike product like FollowTheMoney.org, which offers no explanation of (1) where they got their data (2) how “fresh” it is (3) matching methodology of associating certain monetary donations with certain industry segments, and also does not offer voting records


## Reason
Voting drives are nice, but getting uninformed people to cast ballots is not helping anyone. Voters need a _quick_, _user-friendly_ way to tell who a politician really is.

Who has the time to search for hours and hours through newspapers and online articles in the (possibly vain) hope of finding unbiased information on each and every candidate?

Voters need to know:
1. whose money has the potential to influence a politician (campaign finance records).
1. how the politician voted (voting records).

By putting these two pieces of information together in a succinct mobile platform, we can turn uninformed voters into informed voters.
