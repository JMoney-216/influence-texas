     and is supported by <a href="https://www.open-austin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Austin</a> and

  <h4>About Our Data</h4>
  <p>
    <b>Legislature, Bill, and Voting</b> records are provided by <a href="https://openstates.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open States</a>, a project supported by the nonprofit <a href="http://openmediafoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Media Foundation</a> that scrapes data from the Texas House and Senate journals. This app features records from the 85th regular and special legislative sessions.
  </p><p>
    <b>Campaign finance</b> records are supplied by the nonprofit <a href="http://www.tpj.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Texans for Public Justice</a>, which obtains <i>Contribution and Expenditure</i> data dutifully filed with the Texas Ethics Commission by all candidates, political committees, and political parties from the 2016 campaign cycle. This app shows the top 25 donors to each politician and the top 25 donations of each featured donor that has contributed an aggregate amount of $2,500 or more.
